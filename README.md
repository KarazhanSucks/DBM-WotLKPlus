# DBM-WotLKPlus (3.3.5a)

------------



Core addon backported from Retail by Barsoomx (https://github.com/Barsoomx/) and Zidras (https://github.com/Zidras/).
Thank them for most (if not all) of the features.

------------

Main purposes of this repo is to see if Cataclysm and MoP mods can be easily backported for use in the BlueRing server and tracking Mythic and Heroic modes of the other dungeons.

Raids will be added once the server progresses upto that point.
